🔍 **Key Analytical Questions**

This analysis is guided by the following research questions:

1) Which stocks experienced the strongest price growth YTD?
2) Which sectors have the highest market capitalization?
3) Which sectors may be overvalued based on valuation metrics?
4) Which industries generate the most free cash flow? (Indicating potential for dividends or reinvestment.)
